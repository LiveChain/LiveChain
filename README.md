### Light weight blockchain project best suited for IOT devices âš¡
Now a days usage of IOT devices is increasing exponentially 8.7 billion in 2012 to 50 billion in 2020, whereas active connection for IOT devices increases 3.3 billion in 2015 to 9.8 billion in 2020. Its estimated to have 24 billion connection by 2024.  
Today, most of these IOT devices are being controlled by some central servers either of the manufacturer of the device or some leased servers. It will be much harder to fulfil the demand in very near future with such a hike in number of devices and the number of connections. The communication between any two devices be much harder and slower, even, can fail on single point failure.  These devices going to perform certain tasks including some of the critical and hazardous tasks. For such devices, security is a basic requirement and is to be taken care of.  
So, itâ€™s better to have a decentralized network that can relay message faster reliably, securely without failure, consuming low power.
